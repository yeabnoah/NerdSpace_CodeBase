# Nerdspace Project

Nerdspace is a comprehensive project consisting of web, mobile, and backend codebases. The backend stack utilizes Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. The web application is built with React and Vite, while the mobile app is developed using Expo, React Native, and utilizes Context API and Zustand for state management.

## Backend

The backend of Nerdspace is developed using the following technologies:

- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database program, using JSON-like documents with schema.

## Web Application

The web application of Nerdspace is developed using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience.

## Mobile Application

The mobile application of Nerdspace is developed using the following technologies:

- **Expo**: An open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
- **React Native**: A framework for building native applications using React.
- **Context API**: A React feature for managing state within an application.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scaleable state management library for React.
